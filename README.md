###### Story time 
```
  When I was in college, I took a computer science class for the first time.
  
  Me, Week 1: I should drop this course
  Me, Week 2: I should drop this course
  Me, Week 3: It's too late to drop this course
  Me, Week 4: This is boring
  Me, Week 5: Why am I learning this?
  Me, Week 6: Why am I learning this?
  ...
  Me, Graduation: Degree in Computer Science

```
A few facts to start with:
  - [x] We use computers every hour of every day
  - [x] Computers work because a human being wrote the code to make them work
  - [x] You could be that human being
