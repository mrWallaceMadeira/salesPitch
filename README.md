# Computers: ?
For our first act as a class, please watch [this video](https://youtu.be/GdonmCgg3lE)

### My sales pitch
> Computer science can be daunting to most people. It is a wide ranging subject & it's pieces aren't always related. It can often feel like the Ronco egg scrambler.
> It may make you feel stupid or just adrift in a sea of unrelated information.
> But it is ***so important*** to understand.
> I won't give you the "STEM jobs are in high demand & pay well..." speil. That's not what an education is for. I want to convince you that this subject is not only worth your time but crucial to being a ***good citizen***. Even more than me, you all will be forced to exist in a highly technical world. These technologies
> already shape the way you eat, sleep and move about the world. You don't need to be Mark Zuckerberg or fall in love with coding. But I think you must understand 
> the world around you.  In some small way, you probably agree with me (given you haven't dropped out yet). To end my pitch, please watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncbb5B85sd0). You are all the next generation of leaders (politicians or not) & technology is here to stay.

### *Dismounts soap box*
All that said, you're (hopefully) here to stay for the next 5 weeks.\
This is what we'll be doing:
- [x] Learning the basics of writing code in Java
- [x] Covering a few special topics in computer science: the Internet, WiFi, etc.
