# Computers: ?
For our first act as a class, please watch [this video](https://youtu.be/GdonmCgg3lE)

### My sales pitch
> Computer science can be daunting to most people. It is a wide ranging subject & it's pieces aren't always related.\
> But it is ***so important*** to understand.
> I won't give you the "STEM jobs are in high demand & pay well..." speil. That's not what an education is for.
> I want to convince you that this subject is not only worth your time but crucial to be a ***good citizen***.
> Even more than me, you all will be forced to exist in a highly technical world. These technologies already shape the way we eat, sleep and move about the world.
> The whole reason you haven't dropped out yet is that some part (however small) beleives that 

This class will only touch on a small part: coding\

###### Story time 
```
  When I was in college, I took a computer science class for the first time.
  
  Me, Week 1: I should drop this course
  Me, Week 2: I should drop this course
  Me, Week 3: It's too late to drop this course
  Me, Week 4: This is boring
  Me, Week 5: Why am I learning this?
  Me, Week 6: Why am I learning this?
  ...
  Me, Graduation: Degree in Computer Science

```
###### Takeaways
  1. Don't knock it until you try it. Again. 
  2. Computers can be boring
